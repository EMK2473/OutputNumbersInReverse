## Description
The OutputNumbersInReverse program reads a list of integers from user input and prints them in reverse order. It first takes the number of elements to be entered and then the integers themselves. After capturing all input, it outputs the integers in reverse order, separated by commas.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/EMK2473/OutputNumbersInReverse.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd OutputNumbersInReverse 
```
- Compile the OutputNumbersInReverse.java file: 
```Java
- javac OutputNumbersInReverse.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java OutputNumbersInReverse
```

## Application Usage
The program expects two sets of inputs: The first input is an integer specifying how many numbers will be input. The second set of inputs contains the integers to be reversed. The program reads the integers, stores them in an array, and prints them in reverse order separated by commas. Example 

Input:
```Java
5 10 20 30 40 50 
```
Output:
```Java
50,40,30,20,10,
```
